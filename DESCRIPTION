Title: Time-Varying Parameters by Ridge Regressions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Philippe Goulet Coulombe
Maintainer: PGC <gouletc@sas.upenn.edu>
Description: This function runs 2SRR, a technique allowing parameters of a linear equation(s) to evolve according to random walks. Computations are carried via a closed-form solution in the form of data-augmented ridge regression rather than with typically used burdensome filtering procedures.
